## 🛰️ Project Overview

SpaceX has revolutionized space transportation by making rocket reusability a reality.
In this project, we aim to **predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully**, based on factors like payload mass, launch site, orbit type, and flight number.

The analysis is performed using **real-world data** from the SpaceX REST API and Wikipedia, followed by **data wrangling, exploratory analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling**.

## 📊 Key Steps

1. **Data Collection**

   * Fetched launch data from the [SpaceX REST API](https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches/past).
   * Collected additional data from Wikipedia.
   * Created a flowchart to visualize the data retrieval process.

2. **Data Wrangling**

   * Cleaned and merged datasets.
   * Handled missing values and formatted categorical variables.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Performed data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   * Used SQL queries to analyze launch patterns.

4. **Interactive Dashboard**

   * Built an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash to explore launch data dynamically.

5. **Predictive Modeling**

   * Built multiple classification models to predict landing success.
   * Compared performance using evaluation metrics and selected the best-performing model.
